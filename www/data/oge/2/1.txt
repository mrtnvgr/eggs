According to surveys, the popularity of bikes is growing. More than 700 cities in the world have joined a new program for cyclists. Any person can take a vacant bike and park it back at any bike station on their way. One can find information about the bike stations on smartphone maps. Cycling in cities helps to lessen the problems of stress and air pollution. Research held in London in 2017 confirmed this fact. People felt calmer after they rode to the office instead of driving. Also, bikes do not produce harmful gases.

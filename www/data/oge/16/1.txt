The London climate is known for its mild character. Summer temperatures do not normally go above 20 degrees. The city lies only 5 metres above sea level and that's why fogs are common there. The fog is formed by the steam or water concentrated in the air. A couple of centuries ago London fog had a funny name, the pea soup. In reality, it was not funny because the fog contained poisonous smoke from the factories. The mixture of fog and smoke was called smog. In 1952 thousands of Londoners died from it. To improve the situation Londoners started to use oil instead of coal to heat their houses. They managed to get rid of the dangerous smoke.

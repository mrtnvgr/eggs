During the academic year, most students in Russia wear school uniform. Though school uniform is not compulsory, lots of teachers and parents approve of it. They say it helps the students focus on the learning process and avoid distractions. The tradition dates back to 1834. In those days it was obligatory for high school students to wear military clothes. Boys' school jackets were dark-green or navy. For special occasions they were decorated with golden buttons. Also, each school had its own cap colour. Official girls' school uniform appeared 60 years later. Girls had to wear brown dresses with black or white aprons.

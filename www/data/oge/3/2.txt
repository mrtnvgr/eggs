We need to find out how students feel about learning English

How long have you been learning English?
How many English lessons do you have a week?
What do you do in your English lessons?
Why have you chosen English as an exam this year?
What other foreign language or languages would you like to speak? Why?
What would you recommend to students who want to improve their English?

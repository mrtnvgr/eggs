Kew Royal Botanical Gardens are situated in the west of London. They house a collection of 50 000 plants, beautiful galleries and buildings. The history of the Gardens started in 1759. Through the centuries, the Gardens changed only for the better. Royal gardeners used special techniques for growing plants and designing the landscape. Many exotic flowers, bushes and trees were brought from abroad and planted there. They are now kept in greenhouses under appropriate conditions. The gardeners have worked hard to create the suitable climate inside. The beauty of Kew Gardens is open to the public. Londoners and tourists can enjoy flowering plants during regular exhibitions.

new health magazine "Healthy Lifestyle"
We want to devote one of our issues to healthy eating habits

How many meals do you have a day? Which meals do you have?
Which meal is the most important of the day in your opinion?
What do you eat for lunch in your school canteen?
How do you feel about fast food?
Do you think it is important for everyone to have good cooking skills?
What would you recommend to a teenager to stay fit and healthy?

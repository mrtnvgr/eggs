Sea lions are big animals. Unlike other seals, they have typical back flippers and small ears on their head. Male sea lions can weigh up to 800 kilograms. Female animals are much slimmer. Though sea lions look massive, they are very fast swimmers and perfect divers. They really enjoy the water. However, they spend some months of the year on the land bringing up their pups. Since 1967, sea lions have been living in the Far East, in Russia. The local people and tourists can watch and take photos of groups of sea lions on the beaches. Unfortunately, sea lions are becoming endangered. At present, the animals are registered in the Red Book.

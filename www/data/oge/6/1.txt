Tea is a very popular drink. More than 80 percent of Russians have tea every day. Nowadays the most popular way of making tea is using teabags. In fact, the idea of teabags came about completely by accident. In 1904, an American tea merchant sent out samples of his tea in small silk bags. The customers did not realize that they were supposed to get the tea out of the teabags first. They just put the whole bags into boiling water and then drank the tea. They liked the new way to make tea. As for the tea merchant, he started selling his tea in teabags.

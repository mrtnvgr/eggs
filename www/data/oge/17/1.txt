For some people photography is a popular hobby or art. For others, it may be a job or art, but everyone agrees that the invention of the first camera was a great technological event. Amazingly, the first descriptions of a primitive camera were made by Chinese and Greek scientists in the 4th and 5th centuries B.C. However. the earliest photograph that has survived to the present day was taken only in 1826. It was a misty, black-and-white view from a window. Since then, technology has developed greatly. Now we have digital cameras to produce digital images and videos.

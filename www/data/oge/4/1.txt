People have always wanted to learn and share information. At different times they used different methods to exchange news. They made fires and beat drums to signal important events. Later, they invented letters which were carried by special people called "runners". They had to cover long distances to deliver information. The use of horses and birds made the delivery quicker. The state post in Russia appeared in the 17th century. It was rather slow but quite reliable. In 1851, the post started to use the railway. Since then the speed of information exchange has been growing constantly.

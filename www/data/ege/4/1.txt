The fashion industry is considered to be one of the fastest-growing industries today, yet it has faced some significant challenges throughout its history. It's not a secret that fashion industry takes its negative toll on the environment. Clothes production cannot cope with limited water consumption, and its carbon footprint increases daily. People buy tons of cheap garments which end up in landfills in less than a month. The situation might get worse if consumers don't change their habits in the coming years. There are some healthy fashion trends that may help to make fashion sustainable. Consumers are choosing brands that do not hurt animals and the planet in the process. The younger generation chooses second-hand shopping giving clothes another life. And brands promote recycling to save on raw material and natural resources.

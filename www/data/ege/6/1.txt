The turn of the century has been fruitful for the rise of the fashion industry, especially the fast fashion segment. In the last 20 years it increased by about 60 %, with people spending more money on cheaper garments. Brands cut their production cycles and turn to up-to-the-minute designs doing their best to expand and refresh their customers' wardrobes. However, not everything is cream and peaches in the fashion industry. It requires using a lot of water and chemicals while emitting significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Clothing-factory workers work in unsafe conditions and are often underpaid. Some consumers tend to overlook or tolerate these costs of fast fashion, while others expect brands to operate in a different manner. To meet their demands, companies do their best to change their production methods.

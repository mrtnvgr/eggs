Football (or soccer as the game is called in some parts of the world) has a long history. Football in its current form arose in England in the middle of the 19th century. But alternative versions of the game existed much earlier and are a part of the football history. The first known examples of a team game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock, occurred in ancient cultures over 3,000 years ago in pre-Columbian America. In some ritual occasions, the ball would symbolize the sun and the captain of the losing team would be sacrificed to the gods. A unique feature of these ball game versions was a bouncing ball made of rubber â€” no other early culture had access to rubber. The first known ball game which also involved kicking took place in China in the 3rd century BC. It was played with a round ball on an area of a square.

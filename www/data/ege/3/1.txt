With the rise in recent technology we seem to be rapidly losing the art of conversation. Talking on the phone used to be the means of communication for most people, but over the last 20 years texting or instant messaging has developed into one of the most popular ways of keeping in touch with friends and family. Recent studies have shown that people are more likely to text than actually talk. Texting is great for quick short messages and meaningless banter. But it is very difficult to have a deep and meaningful text conversation. Firstly, you cannot hear the intonation when someone is texting you. Secondly, texting lacks eye contact and body language, which are crucial facets of face-to-face communication. So, whatever is happening in your world, put that mobile phone down and talk to someone before you forget how.

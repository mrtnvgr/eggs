If you're not familiar with the Isle of Man, it's a green and pleasant island nation in the middle of the Irish Sea. At only about thirty miles long, it has an incredible choice of things to do and see â€” especially if you're a fan of beautiful landscapes. A day trip around the Island can have you take in diverse and stunning landscapes and fascinating historical sites. For such a calm and peaceful island, it has a long history of conquest, kings, and ancient peoples. If you head all the way north, you'll get to the Point of Ayre. There you'll find a picturesque lighthouse on a long and open rocky beach. It takes seven hours and eighty miles to do a full tour around the Isle of Man. A full and action-packed day from the far north, right down to the south.

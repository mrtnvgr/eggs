Even though you might think that global warming is not a burning issue, there are many dangers. The gradual heating of Earth's surface, oceans and atmosphere is something that is happening in real life in many places. The consequences and effects of global warming are measurable and visible. Scientists report that ice is melting in both polar ice caps and mountain glaciers. Lakes around the world are warming rapidly changing animals' migration patterns and plants' blooming dates. The most immediate and obvious consequence of global warming is the increase in temperatures around the world. As global average temperatures warm, weather patterns are changing. These changes will likely include major shifts in wind patterns, annual precipitation, and seasonal temperature variations.

People have always told stories and legends to explain natural, but mysterious, occurrences such as the Northern Lights. The Vikings believed the Northern Lights were caused by the shining weapons of warriors. The Alaskan people thought the lights were the souls of salmon, deer and other animals. The Indians told the stories of giants living in the North and thought the lights were their torches. The Northern Lights are actually caused by electrons from solar winds. They are attracted to the poles by the magnetic fields found there. They mix with gases in the atmosphere which causes the gases to glow. The Northern Lights are most visible in the far north. They are typically green, purple, red or blue.

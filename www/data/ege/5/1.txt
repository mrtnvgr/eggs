A polar bear walks along a rocky shore, looking for food. The bear would usually be on the sea ice hunting for seals, pouncing when the seal comes up to breathe. But the ice has started to melt earlier and reform later than it was in the past. Without the sea ice, the polar bear must scavenge for other, less nutritious food. These changes in polar sea ice are a result of climate change. But this isn't just affecting polar bears -- climate change affects everyone. Changes in Earth's climate are caused by how much of the Sun's energy is absorbed by the atmosphere. In fact, over the past 650,000 years, our planet has gone through seven ice ages and warming periods. But during the past few hundred years, oil, gas, and coal have powered homes, cars, and factories. That increases Earth's temperature, which contributes to the planet's warming.

Since ancient times, humans have loved and cherished cats as their pets. Today more than 65 million cats reside in Russian homes, with an estimated three cats for every dog on the planet. Yet there is still a lot we don't know about our feline friends - including what they think of their owners. After observing pet cats for several years, scientists have come to an intriguing conclusion: cats don't really understand people the way dogs do. They tend to feel it is they who own their masters, not vice versa. On the contrary, dogs perceive people as being very different from themselves. As soon as they see a human, they change their behaviour. The way a dog plays with a human is completely different from the way it plays with a dog. Cats are independent creatures and they can easily change their owner without changing their habits.

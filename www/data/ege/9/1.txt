An allergy is your immune system's reaction to certain plants, animals, foods, insect bites, or other things. Your immune system protects you from diseases by fighting germs like bacteria and viruses. But when you have allergies, it overreacts and tries to "fight" ordinary things like grass or certain foods. This causes the sneezing, itching, and other reactions that you get with allergies. People may be born with a genetic tendency to have allergies, which means they are more likely to get them than other people are. Many allergies are passed to kids in the genes they get from their parents. You have a better chance of having allergies if your mom or dad or other people in your family have them. Sometimes it's difficult to tell the difference between a cold and an allergy because the symptoms can be similar. If your cold symptoms last more than 2 weeks, you probably have an allergy and not a cold.

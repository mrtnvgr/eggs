Before people stood on the Moon, the United States and the USSR sent robots to the Moon. The robots were the first man-made objects to touch the Moon. Humans landed on the Moon on the 21st of July, 1969. Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their lunar ship, the Eagle, on the surface of the moon. Then, as half the world watched him on television, Armstrong climbed down the ladder of the Eagle and was the first human to touch the Moon. He said, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind." Even though the footprints were left on the moon a long time ago, it is likely that they are still there, as there is no wind or rain, making erosion extremely slow. The footprints do not get filled in or smoothed out. More people landed on the Moon between 1969 and 1972, when the last spaceship, Apollo 17 visited. Eugene Cernan of Apollo 17 was the last person to touch the Moon.

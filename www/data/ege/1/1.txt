Time management is very important for students. When you are in college, you will be taking several classes at a time. Within each class, you'll have assignments and tests with different due dates. It can become really difficult if you are not good at time management. We recommend to write down all your deadlines ahead of time on a calendar, or even on a sheet of paper. This way, you can schedule study time and time to work on assignments according to what is due first. A weekly checklist can also help to better manage your time when you are in college. Here's how it can work. At the start of each week, write down the assignments and projects that are upcoming for that week. You may even use different colours for different subjects. By looking at the checklist, you will make sure that no item is forgotten or overlooked.

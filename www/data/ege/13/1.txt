Everyone loves hobbits. Ask anyone who's a fan of The Lord of the Rings to choose their favourite character and nine times out of ten it will be Samwise Gamgee. He's loyal, innocent and determined and without him Frodo couldn't have saved Middle Earth. He represents the Shire with all its comfort, safety and stability and these same attributes make Hobbit Holes special. For those whose hearts belong forever in the Shire, there's a place they can go to. Called Hobbiton, it's a movie set experience that's nestled in the heart of a small town in New Zealand. Lush pastures are punctuated with 44 tiny Hobbit holes, the Green Dragon Pub, Mill, double arched bridge and the famous Party Tree built directly into the sides of rolling hills. The daily tours allow visitors to enter the small lairs and pretend they're one of the mythical humanoids.

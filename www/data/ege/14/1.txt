Our world is full of mysteries. There are stunning icebergs, roaring waterfalls, dashing jungles and many more. There are also singing sands in Kazakhstan. "Singing sands" is the name of big dunes that produce various sounds in dry weather. The sounds can be heard several miles away and resemble sometimes organ music and sometimes the roars of an aircraft engine. According to local legends, such sounds are songs of desert ghosts and voices of fabulous beasts. Scientists however think that the grains of sands create those sounds as they rub against each other under a wind force. Another miracle can be seen in the Antarctic. These are waves frozen in the air. Of course, it is not a real tsunami. Water cannot freeze instantly and in motion, even in the freezing temperatures. This ice begins to melt in summer and then freezes again â€” many years in a row forming natural sculptures for centuries.

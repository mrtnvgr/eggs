Iceland is known around the world for its hot springs and remarkable scenery. It's called the land of ice and fire. Iceland's national flag has three colours: white, red and blue. White represents ice and snow, red is for fire and blue is for the mountains. Iceland became independent only a century ago, in 1918. Nowadays, more than 60 percent of the population live in the capital. People in Iceland are very creative, though they have the longest workweek in Europe. They love reading and writing. In fact, creative writing is a favourite hobby on the island. The most popular professions in Iceland are artists, musicians and designers.

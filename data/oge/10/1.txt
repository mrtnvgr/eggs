The Moscow Metro is the world's second biggest underground network. It is very convenient, cheap and reliable and it runs on time. That is why it is very popular with the citizens of the Russian capital. There are more than 200 stations in the Moscow Metro. The first line was opened in 1935. It was a very ambitious project of the Soviet government. Most of the central underground stations are really beautiful and look like a museum. In fact, 44 stations of the Moscow metro are recognized as objects of cultural heritage of Russia. Modern stations follow this tradition.

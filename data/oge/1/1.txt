Today it is hard to imagine Moscow being dark at night. Yet, the central streets of the city became bright only in 1730. Before then, Muscovites had to keep candles burning in the windows for passers-by. Most people also carried individual oil lamps when they walked late. During the summer months, candles and oil lamps were not allowed because of the risk of fire. Later, gas lanterns appeared. They were rather effective but the real progress started later, with electric lamps. 448 electric lamps were fixed in the centre of Moscow a century ago. At present, Moscow has a modern system of street lights with electronic control.

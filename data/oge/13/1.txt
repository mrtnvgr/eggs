It's understood that the age of oil and gas is coming to an end. If we continue burning these supplies, we'll soon run out of them. Now everybody agrees that alternative energy technologies are our only prospect for the future. The solar, wind, and water technologies are successfully used nowadays. There are planes, cars, and boats that run without a drop of fuel. Solar Sailor was the first ferryboat in Australia with solar wings. Since 2000 it has been successfully used in Sydney. It holds up to 100 passengers on board and is still popular with residents and tourists. Nowadays ferries like Solar Sailor, which are absolutely eco-friendly, are widely used in many countries for sightseeing, sea parties, and carrying people and goods.

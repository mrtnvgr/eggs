We need to find out how people feel about taking exams

What exams are you going to take at the end of the academic year?
How do you usually feel before you have to do an exam?
What exams do you prefer: oral or written? Why?
How do you prepare for your English exam?
Are exams useful from your point of view? Why do you think so?
What would you recommend to a student who has failed his or her exam?

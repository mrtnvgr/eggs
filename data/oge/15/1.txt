The Black Sea is one of the favourite tourist destinations. It is popular with young people, families with children, and elderly couples. The mild climate and wonderful scenery make Black Sea holidays a very pleasant pastime. Another good thing about it is that the waters of the sea are quite safe. Though it is deep (some areas have a depth of 2200 metres), there are no dangerous creatures like sharks or poisonous jelly-fish in its waters. The Black Sea, however, has a lot of mysteries. The name is one of them. It is believed to have appeared in the 13th century, but there are different explanations of the name's meaning. Some scientists suppose that it means "inhospitable", the others say black denotes the direction - the sea to the north.

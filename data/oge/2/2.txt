new careers centre "Your Future"
We need to find out what students think about their future career

What do you enjoy doing in your free time?
What job did you dream of when you were a child?
Have you already chosen a career? What are you going to be?
How do your parents feel about your career choice?
What school subjects are especially important for your future job?
What would you recommend to a teenager who has difficulty with his or her career choice?

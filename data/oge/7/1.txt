The Volga River is the longest river in Europe. A system of canals connects the Volga with the Baltic, White and Azov seas. Many people consider the Volga the national river and symbol of Russia. It has always played a significant role in the history and culture of our country. Today almost 50 million people live in the Volga basin. In 2008, Volga Day was established to honour the great river. In May, a lot of different festivals are held in the towns and cities which are situated on the Volga banks.

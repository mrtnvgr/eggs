magazine "Environmental Care"
We need to find out how students feel about their hometown

Do you live in the country or in the city?
What is typical winter weather in your hometown?
What place in your hometown do you like most of all?
What environmental problems do people have in your hometown?
Would you like to stay in your home town when you finish school? Why, or why not?
What would you do for your hometown if you were very rich?

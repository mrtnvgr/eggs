We need to find out how students feel about the necessity to protect the environment

What environmental problem do you think is the most serious for our planet?
Describe one environmental problem in your hometown.
Does your family sort the rubbish before throwing it away? Why, or why not?
What can students in your school do to help the environment?
Does a career as an ecologist attract you or not? Why?
What would you recommend teenagers do to make their hometown a better place to live in?

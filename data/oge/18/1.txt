Reading books is a popular hobby and a great way to get new knowledge and skills. It develops your brains and imagination. Technological progress would be impossible without books! In 1995, World Book Day was established. Now it is celebrated in more than 100 countries all over the world. The idea of the event is to encourage people, especially children, to take more interest in literature. On this day, they can discover new books, meet famous and new writers, play different games, and take part in different contests and competitions. There are a lot of prizes to win â€“ the books, of course!

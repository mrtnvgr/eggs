Nowadays football is widespread across the globe but people still associate it with the British Isles. This is probably due to the fact that the official history of football started there in 1863 when the Football Association in England was founded. However, the game is much older. Football was popular in Britain as early as the 2nd century A.D. Though football is considered a male sport, women play it too. The first ladies' teams appeared during World War I. Then the Football Association banned female competitions but the ban did not last long. In 1971 the ban was lifted and now female teams participate in domestic and international games.

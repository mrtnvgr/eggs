new vet clinic "Lassie"
We need to find out how people feel about keeping pets

Have you got a pet?
What pets are most popular in your region?
What pets do you think would be dangerous to keep in a flat? Why?
Why are people so attached to their pets?
Why do people sometimes abandon their pets?
What pet would you recommend to a person who has never had pets? Explain why.

Nowadays people prefer communicating online. However, 50 years ago people sent paper letters to each other. It was the norm to have a mail box full of envelopes with letters. The envelopes were used for keeping letters and documents. The first envelope appeared in England in the first half of the 19th century. In Moscow, massive sales of envelopes started in 1846. The first envelopes were made of white paper. They were of a different format. To post a letter people needed round hand-made stamps. The stamps were fixed in the top right corner of the envelope. In St. Petersburg, stamps were blue, in Moscow they were red. Two years later, envelopes spread over the whole territory of Russia.
